**Goal:** We need a list of our 'Technique Leader' employees to prepare for an upcoming leadership review. Generate a report that shows the 10 most recently appointed 'Technique Leader's. For each of these employees, include their title, the date they became a 'Technique Leader', their first name, last name, gender, and birth date. The results should be ordered first by the date they started as 'Technique Leader' (most recent first), then alphabetically by last name, and finally by first name.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Your query must return a result set with the following columns, in this order:

1. `title` (varchar)
2. `from_date` (date) - The date they started as 'Technique Leader'.
3. `first_name` (varchar)
4. `last_name` (varchar)
5. `gender` (enum)
6. `birth_date` (date)

The results must be ordered as follows:

- Primarily by `from_date` in descending order (most recent first).
- Secondarily by `last_name` in ascending order (alphabetical).
- Finally, by `first_name` in ascending order (alphabetical).

The result set must be limited to the top 10 rows.

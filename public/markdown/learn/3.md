**Goal:** Your task is to retrieve information about employees in the "Development" department. Specifically, you need to find five employees and output only their employee IDs and the department name. This challenge is intentionally less specific than some others, which is by design â€“ to test your ability to think critically about selectivity, satisfy precise requirements, and navigate a slightly more open-ended problem.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Your query's output _must_ include the `dept_name` and `employee_id` columns. No other columns should be present.
- Your result set _must_ contain five rows.
- The query has to get data related to 'Development' department.

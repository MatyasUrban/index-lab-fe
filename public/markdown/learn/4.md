In this chapter, we'll focus on B-Tree indexes, the workhorse of PostgreSQL indexing. They're so fundamental that they're the default choice when you create an index without specifying a type.

### Automatic Index Creation

PostgreSQL automatically creates B-Tree indexes for you in two common scenarios:

1.  **Primary Keys:** When you define a primary key constraint on a table, PostgreSQL automatically creates a unique B-Tree index on the primary key column(s).
2.  **Unique Constraints:** Similarly, a unique constraint automatically triggers the creation of a unique B-Tree index on the specified column(s).

It's important to note that _foreign key constraints do not automatically create indexes_. Creating indexes on foreign keys is a performance optimization that you, as the database engineer, should consider based on your query patterns.

### What is a B-Tree?

A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. This makes it exceptionally well-suited for database indexing.

Imagine a multi-level, branching structure. Each node in the tree contains a set of keys (the values you're indexing) and pointers. The keys are kept in sorted order within each node.

- **Root Node:** The top-level node.
- **Internal Nodes:** Nodes between the root and the leaves. They contain keys and pointers to other internal nodes or leaf nodes.
- **Leaf Nodes:** The bottom-level nodes. These contain the actual indexed values _and_ the crucial **Tuple ID (TID)**. The TID is a pointer that tells PostgreSQL precisely where to find the corresponding row (tuple) in the table's heap blocks. Leaf nodes are connected with each other in a doubly-linked list.

### Logarithmic Lookup: The Power of B-Trees

The magic of the B-Tree lies in its logarithmic lookup time. Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose you have a table with 1,000,000 rows and a B-Tree index on a unique `user_id` column.

- **Sequential Scan (No Index):** Without an index, PostgreSQL would have to potentially examine all 1,000,000 rows to find a specific `user_id`. This is a linear search (O(n)).

- **B-Tree Lookup (With Index):** With a B-Tree index, PostgreSQL can find the correct leaf node in approximately log₂(1,000,000) ≈ 20 steps. That's because at each level of the tree, the search space is roughly halved. From the leaf node, it uses the TID to directly access the relevant row in the heap.

This difference in speed is _enormous_, especially for large tables.

### Creating B-Tree Indexes

Here's how you create a B-Tree index in PostgreSQL, and a breakdown of the syntax:

```sql
-- General Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name [USING index_type] (column_name);

-- Standard way (B-Tree is the default)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);

-- Explicitly specifying B-Tree (same as above)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_btree ON users USING btree (email);
```

**Explanation of the Syntax:**

- `CREATE INDEX`: The keyword to initiate index creation.
- `index_name`: A name you choose for your index. It's good practice to use a descriptive name, often starting with `idx_` to indicate it's an index. For example, `idx_users_email` suggests an index on the `users` table's `email` column.
- `ON table_name`: Specifies the table you're creating the index on.
- `USING index_type`: (Optional) Specifies the type of index. If omitted, PostgreSQL defaults to `btree`. Other index types exist (e.g., `hash`, `gin`, `gist`), but `btree` is the most common and versatile.
- `(column_name)`: The column(s) you want to index. This example uses a single column, but B-Trees can also index multiple columns (covered in later chapters).

The first example (`CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);`) is the most common way to create a B-Tree index. The `USING btree` part is optional because it's the default. The third example explicitly states `USING btree`, which is functionally identical to the first.

### Querying with B-Tree Indexes

Let's see how B-Tree indexes are used in queries.

```sql
-- Example table
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    category VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert 1 million rows (for demonstration)
INSERT INTO products (name, price, category)
SELECT
    'Product ' || i,
    (random() * 100)::numeric(10,2),
    CASE
        WHEN i % 3 = 0 THEN 'Electronics'
        WHEN i % 3 = 1 THEN 'Books'
        ELSE 'Clothing'
    END
FROM generate_series(1, 1000000) AS i;

-- Create an index on product_id (automatically created because it's the primary key)
-- We could also create additional index:
CREATE INDEX idx_products_name ON products(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price ON products(price);

-- Query 1: Equality search (using the primary key index)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = 500000; -- Very fast, uses index

-- Query 2: Equality search (using the name index)
SELECT * FROM products where name = 'Product 500000'; -- Very fast

-- Query 3: Range search (B-Tree index can also be used)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 60; -- Still efficient, uses index

-- Query 4: Ordering (B-Tree index can help)
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 10; -- Index can be used for sorting
```

**Explanation:**

- **Query 1 & 2:** These are highly selective queries (looking for a single, unique row). The B-Tree index allows PostgreSQL to jump directly to the relevant leaf node and then to the heap block.
- **Query 3:** Even though it's a range query, the B-Tree index is still beneficial. PostgreSQL can quickly locate the starting point (price >= 50) and the ending point (price <= 60) within the ordered index and then retrieve the corresponding rows. Because leaf nodes are interconnected, it is easy to traverse the data in leaf nodes and stop once we reach the end of the interval.
- **Query 4:** The B-Tree index maintains sorted order, making `ORDER BY` operations on the indexed column much faster.

### Selectivity and Range Queries

While B-Trees are excellent for range queries, _selectivity_ remains a crucial factor. In the context of a B-Tree index, _selectivity_ refers to the proportion of **leaf nodes** that satisfy the filter condition, relative to the total number of leaf nodes in the index. This concept becomes particularly relevant when dealing with range queries (e.g., `WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 60`) or equality checks on _non-unique_ columns (e.g., `WHERE category = 'Electronics'`), as multiple rows (and therefore multiple leaf nodes) might match the condition.

If your `WHERE` clause matches a _very large_ percentage of the indexed leaf nodes (low selectivity), a full table scan might become more efficient than using the index, because traversing a significant portion of the index structure can, in extreme cases, be more overhead than simply scanning the table. PostgreSQL's query planner automatically makes this determination, but understanding selectivity empowers you to write more efficient queries and design better indexes. Therefore, always aim for high selectivity in your queries to maximize the benefits of indexing.

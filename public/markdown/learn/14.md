**Goal:** The HR department needs to identify employees currently earning a **low salary** (less than $40,000) to initiate performance improvement discussions with their managers. Your task is to provide a highly optimized SQL query to retrieve information on the _first 10_ such employees, sorted by the date they started at their current salary. This report will be generated periodically.

[Note] In this database, a `to_date` value of '9999-01-01' indicates a currently active record (e.g., current salary, current department assignment).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

The query must return the following columns, and _only_ these columns, in this order:

1.  `employee_id` (integer)
2.  `first_name` (varchar)
3.  `last_name` (varchar)
4.  `amount` (integer) - The employee's current salary.
5.  `salary_from_date` (date) - The start date of the current salary.
6.  `manager_id` (integer) - The employee ID of the employee's current manager.
7.  `manager_first_name` (varchar)
8.  `manager_last_name` (varchar)

The result set should be sorted by `salary_from_date` (ascending) and then by `employee_id` (ascending). Limit the output to the first 10 employees. The query _must_ be optimized for performance; you should use a partial index.

**Goal:** The Human Resources department is launching a new mentorship program. To identify potential mentors, they need a highly specific list of employees. The program requires finding the three female employees who were hired most recently _and_ who are the oldest amongst those recent hires. This seemingly contradictory requirement (recent hire, but oldest) necessitates a careful approach to sorting and filtering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

The query must return the following columns, in this exact order:

1.  `id` (integer)
2.  `hire_date` (date)
3.  `birth_date` (date)
4.  `first_name` (varchar)
5.  `last_name` (varchar)

The result set should contain _at most_ 3 rows.

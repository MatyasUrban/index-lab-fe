**Goal:** Find all employees hired at the turn of the millennium (December 31, 1999 to January 1, 2000 inclusive) and display their hire date, first and last name, along with the department they belonged to on that hire date.

NOTE: An employee may have multiple entries in `department_employee` over their career, but on any given date they work in exactly one department.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Each row must contain these columns: `hire_date`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `dept_name`.
- Only include employees whose hire_date falls between '1999-12-31' and '2000-01-01' (inclusive).
- Ensure dept_name reflects the department assignment on the employeeâ€™s hire_date (i.e., join on department_employee.from_date = employee.hire_date).

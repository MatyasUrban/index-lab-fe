In this chapter, we'll explore a specialized type of index designed for blazing-fast equality checks: the **hash index**.

### Equality Only, But _Fast_

Hash indexes have a significant limitation: they can _only_ be used for equality comparisons. This means queries using operators like `=`, and nothing else. You can't use them for range queries (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) or pattern matching (`LIKE`). However, for equality checks, they are incredibly efficient.

```sql
-- Hash indexes are PERFECT for this:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 12345;

-- Hash indexes CANNOT be used for this:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100;
```

### How Hash Indexes Work: Hashing and Hash Tables

The name "hash index" gives away its core mechanism. It uses a **hash function** to transform the indexed column's values into numerical **hash codes**. These hash codes are then stored in a **hash table** data structure.

Think of a hash table like a very organized coat check.

1.  **Hashing:** You give your coat (the original value) to the attendant. The attendant uses a special tag-generating system (the hash function) to create a unique tag number (the hash code) for your coat.
2.  **Hash Table Storage:** The attendant hangs your coat on a rack (the hash table) and places the tag number in a corresponding slot. Crucially, the rack is organized in a way that makes finding a specific tag number extremely fast.
3.  **Retrieval:** When you want your coat back, you provide the original value (you _could_ describe your coat!). The attendant uses the _same_ tag-generating system (hash function) to calculate the tag number again. They then go _directly_ to the corresponding slot in the rack, retrieve the tag, and fetch your coat.

In PostgreSQL, when you execute a query with a `WHERE` clause that uses an equality comparison on a column with a hash index:

1.  **Hash Calculation:** PostgreSQL hashes the value you're searching for using the same hash function used to build the index.
2.  **Hash Table Lookup:** It uses the resulting hash code to quickly locate the corresponding entry (or entries) in the hash table.
3.  **Tuple Retrieval:** The hash table entry points directly to the heap block and tuple ID(s) of the matching row(s).

### Speed and Space Advantages

Hash indexes are typically much faster than B-tree indexes for equality lookups. This is because finding an item in a hash table is, on average, an O(1) operation â€“ a constant-time operation, regardless of the table size. B-tree lookups, while still efficient, are O(log n) operations, which means the time increases logarithmically with the table size.

Furthermore, hash indexes often consume less storage space. A B-tree index needs to store the entire tree structure, including nodes and branching information. A hash index, in contrast, only needs to store the hash codes and pointers to the data.

### Hash Collisions

A crucial detail is how hash indexes handle _collisions_. A collision occurs when two different values produce the _same_ hash code. While good hash functions minimize collisions, they are inevitable. PostgreSQL handles collisions transparently; you don't need to worry about them. It stores all values that map to the same hash code within the same hash table entry, using techniques like chaining or open addressing. This slight overhead is almost always negligible compared to the benefits.

### When to Use (and Not Use) Hash Indexes

- **Use Hash Indexes When:**

  - You _only_ need to perform equality checks on a column.
  - Speed is paramount for these equality checks.
  - You have a large table and want to minimize the index size.

- **Don't Use Hash Indexes When:**
  - You need to perform range queries (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
  - You need to perform pattern matching (`LIKE`, `ILIKE`).
  - You need to sort data using the indexed column (hash indexes don't maintain order).

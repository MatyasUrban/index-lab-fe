In this chapter, we'll go beyond basic indexes and explore how to create indexes that are _precisely_ tailored to your queries. We'll cover custom sort orders and the powerful concept of **functional indexes**. You'll learn how to make your database even faster by matching your indexes to how you _actually_ query your data.

### The Limits of Basic Indexes

You already know that indexes speed up queries. You also know that indexes are ordered, btree indexes by default have ascending order. Let's quickly recap and look at a compound index example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
category TEXT,
price NUMERIC
);

CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price ON products (category ASC, price ASC);
```

This index, `idx_products_category_price`, is great for queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics' ORDER BY price ASC;
```

The database can use the index to quickly find 'Electronics' and then efficiently return the results sorted by price in ascending order. But what happens if we change the sort order?

```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY category ASC, price DESC;
```

Suddenly, our index is _not_ as helpful. PostgreSQL can still _use_ the index, filtering out only electronics category, but it _cannot_ use the index to avoid a separate sorting step, because the index stores prices in _ascending_ order, and we're asking for _descending_ order. This highlights a key limitation: _a basic index is optimized for a specific sort order_.

### Matching Index Order to Query Order

The solution is simple: create an index that _matches_ the desired sort order.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price_desc ON products (category ASC, price DESC);
```

Now, the `idx_products_category_price_desc` index is perfect for the query ordering by `category ASC, price DESC`. PostgreSQL can use the index to both locate the relevant rows _and_ deliver them in the correct order, without an extra sort operation.

### Functional Indexes: Indexing Transformations

But what about cases where we don't just want a different order, but we need to search based on a _transformation_ of the data? This is where **functional indexes** come in.

A functional index doesn't store the raw column value; instead, it stores the _result_ of a function applied to that value.

**Example: Case-Insensitive Search**

Consider a `users` table with a `name` column. Users might enter their names with inconsistent capitalization: "John Doe", "john doe", "JOHN DOE", etc. If we want to find a user by name, regardless of case, a regular index on `name` won't be sufficient. We could use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive comparisons, but that would prevent the use of a standard index.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT
);

INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('John Doe'), ('john doe'), ('JANE DOE');

-- This query will NOT use a regular index on the 'name' column
SELECT * FROM users WHERE lower(name) = 'john doe';
```

Here's where a functional index becomes invaluable:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_lower_name ON users (lower(name));
```

We've created an index on `lower(name)`. This index stores the _lowercase_ version of each name. Now, our query can use the index:

```sql
-- This query WILL use the idx_users_lower_name index!
SELECT * FROM users WHERE lower(name) = 'john doe';
```

Because the query's `WHERE` clause uses the _exact same function_ (`lower(name)`) as the index, PostgreSQL can leverage the index for a fast lookup. It doesn't have to convert every `name` to lowercase during the query; it can directly search the pre-computed lowercase values in the index.

**Another example: Extracting parts of a date**
Another example could be date and time. We can create functional index to only consider year from a timestamp.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_order_year ON orders (date_part('year', order_date));

-- query
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE date_part('year', order_date) = 2023;
```

With this index, the query will perform faster.

### Key Considerations for Functional Indexes

- **Immutability:** The function used in a functional index _must_ be immutable. This means that for a given input, the function _always_ returns the same output. `lower()` is immutable; functions like `random()` or `now()` are not. PostgreSQL enforces this rule.
- **Expression Matching:** For the index to be used, the query's `WHERE` clause (or `ORDER BY` clause) must use the _exact same expression_ as the index definition. Slight variations will prevent index usage.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Like any index, functional indexes add overhead to write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). The function needs to be evaluated and the index updated whenever the underlying data changes.
- **Use case:** Functional index are not suitable for all use cases, you should not create functional indexes if the column will not be searched by a function.

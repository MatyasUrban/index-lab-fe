**Goal:** Determine the number of very short-term employee assignments (one week or less) within each department, providing a list of all departments and a count of how many assignments in each department lasted 7 days or less.

[Note]: There is no need to consider an employee's previous or subsequent assignments in other departments. The statistics should reflect the number of records in the `department_employee` table that meet the duration criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
The query must return two columns:

- `dept_name` (VARCHAR): The name of the department.
- `short_term_assignments` (INT): The count of employee assignments within that department that lasted 7 days or less.

The results _must_ be ordered in descending order by the `short_term_assignments` count.

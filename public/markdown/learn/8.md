In this chapter, we'll explore a powerful optimization technique: **covering indexes** and the resulting **index-only scans**.

### What is a Covering Index?

A **covering index** is an index that contains _all_ the columns needed to satisfy a specific query. This means the database can retrieve all the requested data directly from the index itself, without ever needing to access the table's heap blocks.

### The Magic of Index-Only Scans

When a covering index is used, PostgreSQL performs an **index-only scan**. Since all the necessary data is within the index's leaf nodes, there's no need to fetch the corresponding tuples from the table. This drastically reduces I/O operations, leading to significant performance gains, especially for large tables. Remember, reducing I/O is often the key to database optimization.

### Achieving Covering Indexes

You already have the tools to create covering indexes! Here's a recap of how to achieve them, depending on your query:

1.  **Single Column Queries:** A standard B-tree index on the queried column will automatically be a covering index if you only select that column.

2.  **Multiple Column Queries:** A **compound index** (which you learned about in a previous chapter) on all the columns involved in the `SELECT` list and `WHERE` clause (if applicable for filtering) creates a covering index.

    For example, let's say you have a `users` table and frequently run this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT user_id, email FROM users WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
    ```

    A compound index like this would enable an index-only scan:

    ```sql
    -- You already know how to create this!  This is just a reminder.
    CREATE INDEX idx_users_covering ON users (last_name, email, user_id);
    ```

    The order is important here to enable filteing.

### PostgreSQL's `INCLUDE` Clause

PostgreSQL provides a special `INCLUDE` clause for index creation that offers even more flexibility for achieving index-only scans. This is particularly useful when you want to include columns in the index _solely_ for the purpose of covering the query, _without_ using them for filtering or sorting within the index itself.

**Syntax:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (indexed_column1, indexed_column2) INCLUDE (included_column1, included_column2);
```

**Example:**

Consider a `users` table with columns `id`, `username`, `email`, and `user_unique_id` (a unique identifier that's _not_ the primary key). You often run queries like this:

```sql
SELECT username, user_unique_id FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';
```

You expect to _always_ filter by `username`, but you also want to retrieve `user_unique_id` without hitting the table. You _don't_ expect to filter directly by `user_unique_id`.

Here's how you could use the `INCLUDE` clause:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username_include ON users (username) INCLUDE (user_unique_id);
```

- **`username`:** This is the column used for searching (the index key). The index will be ordered by `username`.
- **`INCLUDE (user_unique_id)`:** This adds `user_unique_id` to the index's leaf nodes. It's _not_ part of the search key, so it doesn't affect the index's ordering. It's simply _stored_ there for quick retrieval.

This index allows the example query to perform an index-only scan. PostgreSQL finds the matching `username` within the index and then directly retrieves the associated `user_unique_id` from the index's leaf node, without accessing the `users` table at all. This avoids table access, which is the primary benefit as loading heap block requires more I/O.

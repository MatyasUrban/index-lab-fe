Welcome to the PostgreSQL Index Optimization Learning Path! In this series of interactive lessons, you'll master a crucial relational database optimization technique: **indexing**, specifically within the context of PostgreSQL.

**What You'll Learn**

This learning path focuses on practical, hands-on techniques to significantly speed up your PostgreSQL queries. We'll concentrate on optimizing queries that retrieve a small portion of a table (high selectivity), a common scenario in many applications. You'll learn how to choose the right index type, design efficient indexes, and understand how PostgreSQL's query planner uses them.

**Prerequisites**

To fully participate in the exercises, you'll need a working PostgreSQL database. We provide an accompanying Docker image that contains the necessary schema and data. Make sure you have Docker installed and running, and that you've pulled and started the image before beginning the exercises. Instructions for this are provided separately.

**How It Works: Learning and Practice**

This learning path is structured into a series of **learning components** and **practice components**.

- **Learning Components:** You're in one right now! These components present concise articles explaining key concepts, illustrated with examples and code. To solidify your understanding, each learning component concludes with a short, single-choice quiz.

- **Practice Components:** These are interactive challenges where you'll apply what you've learned. You'll be given a specific task, and you'll need to write SQL queries to solve it. Your solutions will be evaluated on two key aspects:

  - **Correctness:** Does your query return the _exact same data_ as the reference solution?
  - **Performance:** Is your query _efficient enough_? Specifically, we'll check if your query's runtime is faster than 150% of the reference solution's runtime. This encourages you to think about index usage and query optimization.

**Your Task in Practice Components**

In each practice component, you'll typically write two SQL statements:

1.  **Preparation Query (Optional):** This query runs _before_ your main query. It's _not_ directly evaluated for correctness or performance. This is the perfect place to create any indexes you think are necessary for the task. If you don't need to create an index, you can leave this section blank.

2.  **Select Query:** This is your _main_ query. It's the one that will be evaluated against the reference solution for both correctness and performance. This query should retrieve the data specified in the challenge instructions.

**Important: Evaluation and Reset**

Here's how the evaluation process works behind the scenes:

1.  **Preparation:** Your preparation query (if any) is executed.
2.  **Main Query:** Your select query is executed.
3.  **Evaluation:** The results of your select query are compared to the reference solution. Your query's runtime is also measured.
4.  **Reset:** _Crucially_, the database is reset to its original state after _each_ submission. This is done by rolling back any changes made during your queries (including index creation). This ensures:
    - Your submissions don't interfere with other exercises.
    - You always have a clean environment to work with, even if you make mistakes.

**Troubleshooting:**

If you encounter persistent issues with the database (e.g., unexpected errors), don't hesitate to delete the Docker container and create a new one from the accompanying image. This will give you a fresh start.

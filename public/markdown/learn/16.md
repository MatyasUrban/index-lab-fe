**Goal:** We have a partially damaged employee record for a _single_ employee. We know the employee's hire date (`1989-06-14`), and we have recovered a fragment of their last name (`ith`, which could appear anywhere). Your task is to quickly identify this employee and retrieve their first name, last name, and birth date.

**Acceptance Criteria:** The query output must provide the following columns:

- `first_name` (employee's first name)
- `last_name` (employee's last name)
- `birth_date` (employee's birth date)

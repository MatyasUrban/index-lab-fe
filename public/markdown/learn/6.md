In this chapter, we'll explore **compound indexes**, also known as multi-column indexes, which are powerful tools for optimizing queries that filter on multiple columns. We'll contrast them with single-column indexes and discuss the crucial concept of column order within a compound index.

### Single-Column vs. Compound Indexes

A **single-column index**, as the name suggests, is built on a single column of a table. It's great for queries filtering on _that specific column_.

A **compound index**, on the other hand, is built on _multiple_ columns. It's designed for queries that filter on a combination of those columns.

**Syntax for Creating a Compound Index:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table_name (column_a, column_b, column_c);
```

This creates a compound index named `idx_name` on `table_name`, using the columns `column_a`, `column_b`, and `column_c` _in that specific order_. The order is critically important, as we'll see shortly.

### Advantages of Compound Indexes

- **Faster Queries:** When a query's `WHERE` clause filters on multiple columns covered by a single compound index, PostgreSQL can often use the index directly to locate the matching rows. This is significantly faster than combining results from multiple single-column indexes.
- **Space Efficiency (Potentially):** A single compound index can sometimes be smaller than multiple single-column indexes covering the same columns, especially if there's overlap in the data.

### The Importance of Column Order: The "Leftmost Prefix" Rule and Beyond

The order of columns in a compound index is crucial. PostgreSQL can efficiently use a compound index if the query's filter conditions include a "prefix" of the index's columns, starting from the left. However, it's not _just_ about the absolute leftmost prefix. Let's clarify:

With an index on `(A, B, C)`, these filter conditions can _potentially_ utilize the index:

- `WHERE A = ... AND B = ... AND C = ...` (Best Case: Uses all parts of the index.)
- `WHERE A = ... AND B = ...` (Very Efficient: Uses the first two parts of the index.)
- `WHERE A = ...` (Efficient: Uses the first part of the index.)
- `WHERE A = ... AND C = ...` (Can use the index, but less efficiently than using A and B. PostgreSQL can use the index on A to narrow down the rows, but then needs to check C within those rows. The efficiency here depends heavily on the selectivity of A and the distribution of C within A.)

These conditions will _not_ efficiently use the index:

- `WHERE B = ...`
- `WHERE C = ...`
- `WHERE B = ... AND C = ...`

**Example:**

Let's say we have a table `employees` and a compound index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_lastname_firstname ON employees (last_name, first_name);
```

- **Efficiently Uses Index:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Smith' AND first_name = 'John'; -- Uses both columns
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Smith'; -- Uses leftmost column
  ```
- **Does _NOT_ Use Index:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'John'; -- Skips the first column
  ```

### Practical Example: Dates and Column Order

Consider a table `events` storing dates:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
event_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
year INT,
month INT,
day INT,
event_description TEXT
);
```

Let's create two compound indexes with different column orders:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_events_ymd ON events (year, month, day); -- Year, Month, Day
CREATE INDEX idx_events_dmy ON events (day, month, year); -- Day, Month, Year
```

Now, let's analyze the performance of a range query:

```sql
-- Query 1: Using idx_events_ymd (Year, Month, Day)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM events WHERE year = 2023 AND month BETWEEN 1 AND 3;

-- Query 2: Using idx_events_dmy (Day, Month, Year)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM events WHERE year = 2023 AND month BETWEEN 1 AND 3;

```

You'll likely observe that `Query 1` (using `idx_events_ymd`) is _significantly_ faster. Why?

- **idx_events_ymd (Year, Month, Day):** PostgreSQL can use the index to quickly narrow down the search to the year 2023, then efficiently scan within that year for months 1 to 3. It traverses a small, contiguous portion of the index tree.
- **idx_events_dmy (Day, Month, Year):** Even though `year` and `month` are in the filter, because the index starts with `day`, and `day` isn't constrained, PostgreSQL cannot efficiently narrow down the initial search using the index. It has to consider all days before applying the year and month filters.

This illustrates how column order, even when filtering is _possible_, dramatically affects the efficiency of index traversal. The natural order (year, then month, then day) is more aligned with how we typically query date ranges. Think of it like organizing a book: Year (Chapter), Month (Subchapter), Day (Sub-subchapter). It's much easier to find a specific date if the book is organized chronologically.

**Guideline for Column Order:**

Don't just put the most selective column first. Instead, **consider the _logical hierarchy_ of your data**, much like organizing a book with chapters, subchapters, and sub-subchapters. This logical ordering often leads to more efficient index usage for common query patterns.

### Multiple Single-Column Indexes and Bitmap Index Scans

If you don't have a suitable compound index, but you _do_ have single-column indexes on the relevant columns, PostgreSQL might use a **bitmap index scan**.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_events_year ON events (year);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_month ON events (month);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM events WHERE year = 2023 AND month = 10;
```

In this case, PostgreSQL might:

1.  Use `idx_events_year` to create a bitmap representing rows where `year = 2023`.
2.  Use `idx_events_month` to create a bitmap representing rows where `month = 10`.
3.  Perform a bitwise AND operation on the two bitmaps. This results in a final bitmap representing rows that satisfy _both_ conditions.
4.  Perform a **bitmap heap scan**: Read only the heap blocks (table pages) indicated by the final bitmap.

While bitmap index scans can be more efficient than full table scans, they are generally _less_ efficient than using a well-designed compound index. The process of creating and combining bitmaps adds overhead.

### Final Thought

Compound indexes are powerful tools for optimizing multi-column queries. The _order_ of columns within the index is paramount, and you should consider not only the leftmost prefix rule but also the logical hierarchy of your data to maximize efficiency. While multiple single-column indexes can sometimes be used via bitmap index scans, a single, well-chosen compound index is usually the superior solution for performance.
